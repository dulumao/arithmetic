# Arithmetic parser

This library parses and solves a mathematical expression.

It uses a Shunting-Yard algorythm.

Usual mathematic constants and functions are defined in this package (see doc).
Additional can be defined using the functions `RegisterVariable` and `RegisterFunction`.

## TODO

* Documentation (lot of it)
* Link references (Rob Pike golang lexing, Shunting-Yard, extended Shunting-Yard)
* Unit Tests

## Disclaimer

This lib is still at early development stages. The API is most likely susceptible to change.
Beside, it is not (yet) fully tested.
